# DraftKings NHL Parlay Picks — Thursday, February 26, 2026
**Bet size: $0.25 per parlay**

## BEFORE YOU BET — CHECK THESE FIRST (morning of Feb 26)

These injury statuses will change lines dramatically. Look them up before placing anything:

| Player | Team | Status | Why It Matters |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| Connor McDavid | Oilers | Likely OUT (hand from Olympics) | Changes Oilers/Kings line from EDM -150 to near coin flip |
| Leon Draisaitl | Oilers | Questionable (hand) | If both McDavid AND Drai sit, Kings become favorites |
| Sidney Crosby | Penguins | Out (MCL sprain, Olympics) | Without him, Penguins/Devils is a coin flip |
| Igor Shesterkin | Rangers | Likely RETURNING (full practice) | If he starts, Rangers at -122 is cheap |
| Linus Ullmark | Senators | "Returning Thursday" per reports | Confirm he actually dresses |
| Rantanen | Avalanche | OUT (re-injured at Olympics) | Major loss for Colorado |

## THE THREE PARLAYS

---

### PARLAY 1 — "Likely to Hit" (Safe)
**Goal: High probability, modest payout**

| Pick | Game | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Boston Bruins ML | Columbus @ Boston, 7:00 PM | Home, rested, 7-3 H2H vs Columbus in recent years. Pavel Zacha cleared to return. Bruins are the cleaner team here and have everything going their way. |
| Nashville Predators ML | Chicago @ Nashville, 8:00 PM | Chicago is 1-6 in their last 7 games and 3-13 in their last 16 against Nashville specifically. Nashville at home, rested. This is the most lopsided matchup on the slate. |
| Detroit Red Wings ML | Detroit @ Ottawa, 7:00 PM | Detroit is 2-0 against Ottawa this season, 6-1 run before the break, and the better team by 9 points in the standings. Ottawa's goalie Ullmark is returning from illness — his status may not be 100%. |

**Expected combined odds: roughly +280 to +350**
**Estimated payout on $0.25: ~$0.95–$1.13 (profit ~$0.70–$0.88)**

> These three teams are all clean situational favorites. No back-to-back problems, no major injury wildcards, strong H2H records. If you're betting one parlay to be safe, this is it.

### PARLAY 2 — "Likely to Hit, Higher Return"
**Goal: Moderate probability, meaningfully better payout**

| Pick | Game | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Boston Bruins ML | Columbus @ Boston, 7:00 PM | Same reasoning as above — the safest pick on the slate. |
| Nashville Predators ML | Chicago @ Nashville, 8:00 PM | Same reasoning — cleanest mismatch on the board. |
| Carolina Hurricanes ML | Tampa Bay @ Carolina, 7:00 PM | Tampa is playing the SECOND NIGHT OF A BACK-TO-BACK. They played Toronto on Feb 25 and now travel to Raleigh. Carolina is rested, playing at home, and goalie Brandon Bussi has a 2.08 GAA this year (elite). Carolina -150 is fair value against a tired Tampa team. |
| Los Angeles Kings ML | Edmonton @ Los Angeles, 10:30 PM | If McDavid is confirmed out (check game day), the Oilers -150 line is badly mispriced. Kings have Artemi Panarin (just acquired from Rangers), are rested at home, and Oilers are on a back-to-back. This is the best value on the entire slate IF you confirm McDavid status before betting. |

**Expected combined odds: roughly +650 to +900 (depending on how Kings line moves)**
**Estimated payout on $0.25: ~$1.88–$2.50 (profit ~$1.63–$2.25)**

> **Important:** Only run this parlay if you confirm McDavid is out before placing the bet. If he's out, the Kings pick becomes the strongest value on the slate. If he plays, drop the Kings pick and the parlay becomes a 3-teamer.

---

### PARLAY 3 — "High Payout, Reasonable Chance"
**Goal: Long shot that's actually informed, not random**

| Pick | Game | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Minnesota Wild ML | Minnesota @ Colorado, 9:00 PM | Colorado is the #1 team in the NHL, BUT: they're playing the second night of a back-to-back AND Mikko Rantanen (their best scorer, just traded there) is out on IR. Minnesota is 4th in the league, rested, and Kirill Kaprizov is healthy. The Wild have everything to gain here as informed underdogs. |
| Los Angeles Kings ML | Edmonton @ Los Angeles, 10:30 PM | Same as above — McDavid likely out, Oilers on back-to-back, Kings rested with Panarin. This line should move hard once McDavid is officially scratched. |
| Philadelphia Flyers ML | Philadelphia @ NY Rangers, 8:00 PM | The Flyers have a 61-point record vs the Rangers' 50 points. Rangers have lost 8 of their last 10. Yes, Shesterkin may return — but even so, the Rangers are a shell of themselves (Panarin was traded away, team is rebuilding). Flyers are only +113, meaning the market barely believes the Rangers are better. Flyers on the back end of a back-to-back is a real risk, but this is a spot where the "worse" team on paper is actually the more complete one. |

**Expected combined odds: roughly +1100 to +1600**
**Estimated payout on $0.25: ~$3.00–$4.25 (profit ~$2.75–$4.00)**

> This is still an *informed* long shot — not a random flier. Every pick has a specific, researched edge: Rantanen missing + Avs B2B, McDavid missing + Oilers B2B, and a Rangers team in freefall. The biggest risk is Shesterkin confirming he starts for the Rangers, which would make that leg harder. Check lineups.

## QUICK REFERENCE: GAMES TO AVOID

| Matchup | Why Skip |
|---------|----------|
| Devils @ Penguins | Entire outcome depends on Crosby's health. Don't bet it without confirmed lineup. |
| Maple Leafs @ Panthers | Both teams depleted (Barkov out for season, Tavares out, both on B2B). Coin flip. |
| Kraken @ Blues | Kraken on B2B, Blues are bad but rested at home. Murky. |
| Flames @ Sharks | Two mediocre teams, no strong edge. |
